Advanced Sports Betting Prediction System
Step 1: Fetch Upcoming Games
We can use the balldontlie.io API to retrieve upcoming NBA matches.

python
Copiar
Editar
import requests

# Fetch NBA games for a given date range
url = "https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/games?start_date=2024-02-02&end_date=2024-02-03"
response = requests.get(url).json()

# Display the first few scheduled games
for game in response['data'][:5]:
    print(f"{game['home_team']['full_name']} vs {game['visitor_team']['full_name']} - Date: {game['date']}")
Step 2: Collect Player & Team Statistics
To predict performance, we fetch stats for players participating in upcoming matches.

python
Copiar
Editar
def get_player_stats(player_name):
    url = f"https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/players?search={player_name}"
    response = requests.get(url).json()
    
    if response['data']:
        player_id = response['data'][0]['id']
        stats_url = f"https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/stats?player_ids[]={player_id}&season=2023"
        stats_response = requests.get(stats_url).json()
        return stats_response['data']
    return None

player_name = "LeBron James"
stats = get_player_stats(player_name)

if stats:
    print(f"Recent games of {player_name}:")
    for game in stats[:5]:
        print(f"üèÄ Points: {game['pts']}, Rebounds: {game['reb']}, Assists: {game['ast']}")
Step 3: Predict Future Player Performance Using Machine Learning
We use Linear Regression to predict player performance.

python
Copiar
Editar
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Simulated past game data: (minutes, shots attempted, rebounds, assists)
X = np.array([[34, 20, 8, 7], [30, 18, 5, 6], [40, 25, 10, 9], [28, 15, 3, 4], [38, 22, 9, 8]])  
y = np.array([30, 25, 35, 12, 40])  # Actual points scored

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict score for an upcoming game
new_game = np.array([[36, 22, 7, 6]])  # Expected performance
prediction = model.predict(new_game)
print(f"üìä Predicted Points: {prediction[0]:.2f}")
Step 4: Compare Predictions with Betting Odds
We check if the prediction offers value compared to bookmaker odds.

python
Copiar
Editar
def betting_value(predicted_points, bookmaker_line):
    edge = predicted_points - bookmaker_line  # Difference between prediction and sportsbook line
    if edge > 3:
        return "üî• Strong Bet! Value detected."
    elif edge > 0:
        return "‚ö†Ô∏è Close call, but might be worth considering."
    else:
        return "‚ùå Avoid this bet."

# Example: Sportsbook line for player points is 27.5
bookmaker_line = 27.5
print(betting_value(prediction[0], bookmaker_line))
Step 5: Send Automatic Betting Alerts
If the model finds a valuable bet, send an email notification.

python
Copiar
Editar
import smtplib
import os

def send_alert(subject, message):
    server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587)
    server.starttls()
    
    # Secure authentication (NEVER store credentials in plain text!)
    EMAIL = os.getenv("EMAIL_USER")  # Use environment variables
    PASSWORD = os.getenv("EMAIL_PASS")
    
    server.login(EMAIL, PASSWORD)
    
    email_message = f"Subject: {subject}\n\n{message}"
    server.sendmail(EMAIL, EMAIL, email_message)
    server.quit()

# If our model detects a strong betting opportunity, send an alert
if "üî•" in betting_value(prediction[0], bookmaker_line):
    send_alert("High-Value Bet Detected!", f"üèÄ Bet on LeBron James to score {prediction[0]:.2f} points!")
How to Improve the System by 1000%
To make this system exponentially better, we should:

‚úÖ Use Live APIs for real-time player stats and betting odds.
‚úÖ Improve the Machine Learning Model by using XGBoost or Neural Networks instead of simple regression.
‚úÖ Analyze Team Matchups ‚Äì Factor in defensive stats (e.g., opponent‚Äôs defense vs. position).
‚úÖ Automate Market Analysis ‚Äì Compare predictions with multiple sportsbooks to find the best odds.
‚úÖ Integrate Telegram or WhatsApp Alerts instead of email for instant notifications.
‚úÖ Develop a User Dashboard with historical data, predictions, and betting trends.
